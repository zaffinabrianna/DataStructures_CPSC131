# Instructions

In this project, you'll implement a custom vector class named ```MyVector```. The ```MyVector``` class will have much of the functionality of the familiar ```std::vector``` class, including the ability to dynamically resize.

## Warning

Although you've been warned to both start and submit your assignments early, many students still believe they can start closer to the deadline and get a good grade (or plead for more time). If this sounds like you, go back to the syllabus and re-read the sections related to starting/submitting early, and the related consequences of not doing so.

This first project is usually much more difficult than many students anticipate.

You have been warned! (again)

## Source Files

All your code should be implemented in the *MyVector.hpp* file. Only code written in the *MyVector.hpp* file will be considered for your grade.

If you inspect the *MyVector.hpp* file, you'll notice a skeleton structure has been prepared for you. All required class methods have been declared with empty bodies. You won't need to worry about arguments, return types, or method names; All you need to do is complete the body of each function. Note that all methods should be *inline* (body present where the declaration occurs). Read the comment blocks above each method carefully, as they will help explain how your vector implementation should behave.

If you wish, you may modify and use *main.cpp* to help debug while you develop ```MyVector```, as it won't be considered for grading. This file is basically empty and does not need to be developed unless you think it will be useful to debug your ```MyVector``` implementation as you work.

Of course, per the *Code Submission Guidelines* document, you'll need to create a *README.md* file according to specifications.

***Do not modify*** any other files in your repository.

## Resources for Learning

You may research the ```FixedVector``` code repository discussed during lecture to help guide you. However, ***be very careful not to plagiarize code***. A good test to determine whether you have unintentionally plagiarized code, is whether you are able to write all the code from scratch *without* referencing someone else's code. If you find yourself repeatedly getting stuck until you reference someone else's code, it may be a sign you need to study a bit more and start your project again from scratch to be safe.

You may also draw inspiration from explanations of the standard ```std::vector``` class on reference websites like [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector). You may also want to study our slideshows.

## Execution and Testing

Execution and testing are controlled with a *Makefile* written for [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). The included Makefile has several targets you can use during development. As mentioned earlier, do not modify the *Makefile* file.

See a help menu with available commands:
```console
$ make help
```

See a quick preview/estimate of your grade with the following command:
```console
$ make test
```

Execute the program defined by *main.cpp* (which initially does nothing and is only there for you to debug your vector):
```console
$ make run
```

### Hints

This section for general hints.


#### Memory Leak Tests (Valgrind)

The tests use a program called [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) to check for memory leaks. You may fail the leak checker test when your program leaks memory, but *also* if your program attempts to access invalid memory. This means you shouldn't only check for `new`/`delete` issues that leak memory, but also all code that could potentially access an out-of-bounds index in your dynamic arrays.

You can better understand Valgrind's output by studying the official [quick start guide](https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/quick-start.html) or other valgrind tutorials found online.

## Submission

You should push your code to Github during development on a regular basis. When you are ready to submit your code for grading, you will submit through [Gradescope.com](https://www.gradescope.com/). Your instructor has already linked Canvas with Gradescope, so you will (hopefully) find you already have an account at Gradescope using your school email address. You might need to verify your email address there.

Once logged in, you should see entries for this class and this assignment. Within the assignment page, you can link your Github account to Gradescope, allowing you to quickly submit your project repository for grading. Gradescope will automatically process your code and send your grade directly to Canvas.

You may submit your code as many times as you want while you develop; Only the most recent submission will count towards your grade.

This means your workflow might look similar to the following:

1. Develop code
2. Push to Github whenever you make significant progress.
3. Go back to Step 1 if needed
4. Submit code to Gradescope
5. If grade earned is acceptable, finish. Otherwise, go back to Step 1

If you forget to submit through Gradescope, you will receive a zero grade.

Please note that all grades are subject to further deductions via manual grading, as needed.

## Due Date Extensions

Please also note, extensions will generally not be given. ***Do not wait*** to the last days to work on your project, and ***do not wait*** to the last day to submit your code. Issues with your computer, wifi, Gradescope, Github, or most other things will not result in a due date extension. In other words: Plan to ***submit your project early!***

Remember: You have lots of time to complete your project. Take advantage of that time.
